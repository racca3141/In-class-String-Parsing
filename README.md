# In-class-String-Parsing

Write a function with the following prototype that returns a name in proper order:

Flintstone, Fred W.

string lastNameFirst(string name[]);

1. Instantiate a string array with three elements named userName in the main.  Use userName[0] to store the users first name, userName[1] to store the middle name, and userName[2] to store the last name.
2. Populate the string array with user information.
3. Send the string array, userName, to the function which will return a single string in proper format as shown above.  Be sure to capitalize the strings.
4. Output the result in the main.

You may/should use function composition. That is, you can use the function created in the previous assignment within this function to ensure that the user name is properly capitalized. We will reuse this function later in the course.

First name: anna rose
Middle name: bailey
Last name: smith
Your name is: Smith, Anna Rose B.
